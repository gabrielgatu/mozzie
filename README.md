# Mozzie

Mozzie is the core of an artificial intelligence I'm working on, and still in alpha stage, that
takes a phrase and produces an equivalent intent, used by micro-controllers to execute the command parsed.

The logic behind is divided into 5 steps:

- 1: Phrase normalization
- 2: Language-detection and translation
- 3: Word parsing and categorizing
- 4: Intent creation
- 5: Dispatching

# Contribution

Just open an issue/pull request and describe it in a detailed way. Always be polite and respect others 
work. I'll do my best to keep up.

# Naming

Mozzie, from White Collar, obviously ;)
